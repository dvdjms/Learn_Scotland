# JS project: History of Scotland (educational quiz)
​
## MVP
​
Create an educational quiz app, that allows users to answer multiple choice questions and gain a score that is saved in a database to be used in a leaderboard. Extra info is shown to user on answering qs. Users will also have the opportunity to add their own contribution of a "Scottish object" in a forum/posts page. App has a consistent CSS theme throughout.
​
## Extensions
​
- alternate set of questions that requires user to input answer, rather than multiple choice, giving user choice of difficulty.
- give forum page extra functionality of comments
- produce questions from MoS objects
- upgrade questions to include apis/ libraries e.g. map question changed from static images to interactive, images rendered as 3D objects.
- increase complication level of CSS, to include interesting transitions, right/wrong button highlighting etc.
