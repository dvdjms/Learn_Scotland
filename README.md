## Idea



Since Covid-19 many entertaining industries are getting a shortage in the number of users. Based on an [open source statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/586826/national-museum-of-scotland-visitor-numbers-united-kingdom-uk/)(figure below) The national museum of Scotland
is not excluded. Our group has volunteered to contribute to the popularisation of Scotland and the National Museum of Scotland and went on the trip to investigate
how we can improve visitors' experience. The museum has interactive screens which display different quizzes based on a historical object within the museum. Therefore,
we have decided to make an interactive app/website that can be possibly used within the museum.

* ![JavaScript]
* ![Tailwind]
* ![MongoDB]
* ![Express]

## Brief

Our initial brief was extremely ambitious, and so as our team. Together by following the iterative model (development cycle), we have managed 5 days to accomplish the following tasks (shown bellow).

**MVP**


- [x] Create an educational quiz app.
- [x] Make a multiple-choice quiz and leaderboard.
- [x] Generate a database.
- [x] Construct a forum page.

<!-- API find or make -->

 Extensions 

Some of the features currently in progress:

- [x] An alternate set of questions that requires the user to input answers
- [x] Give the forum page extra functionality of comments
- [x] Produce questions from MoS objects 
- [x] Upgrade questions to include APIs/ libraries

 Goals 

- [x] Get as close as possible to an efficient app development cycle
- [ ] Create functions that are out of the scope of our course

## Challenges

Here are some of the things we've found difficult:

* Learning a new framework while planning & building 
* Working with a team online and onsite
* Making login functionality
* File structuring & naming conventions as the project scaled up in size

## Running a Learn Scotland demonstration

Run Locally

Clone the project and go to the project directory:
```
cd Learn_Scotland
  ```
Install dependencies in both the client and the server folders:

```
cd client
npm install

cd server
npm install
```
Seed the database. Within the server folder:
```
npm run seeds
```
Run express (leave running in a terminal window). Within the server folder:
```
npm run server:dev
```
Run React development environment (leave running in a terminal window). Within client folder:
```
npm start
```
The application is running on port 3000 so visit http://localhost:3000/ to try out!
